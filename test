1. Ticket Status Updates ( Done)
Allow users to check the status of their tickets. You could implement a command like /status where users can input their ticket ID to get updates.
2. User Authentication
Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can create tickets or check their status. This could be done using a simple username/password system or integrating with an existing user database.
3. Admin Dashboard
Create an admin interface where administrators can view all tickets, update their status, and respond to users. This could be a separate command that only admins can access.
4. FAQs and Help Command
Add a command like /help that provides users with frequently asked questions and answers about the vaccination campaign or the bot itself.
5. Feedback Collection
After resolving a ticket, ask users for feedback on their experience. This could help improve the service and gather valuable insights.
6. Multilingual Support
Expand the bot to support multiple languages. You could allow users to choose their preferred language at the start.
7. Rich Media Responses
Use images, videos, or documents to provide more information. For example, you could send infographics about vaccination procedures or safety tips.
8. Reminders and Notifications
Implement a reminder system that notifies users about upcoming vaccination dates or follow-up appointments.
9. Integration with Other Services
Integrate with external APIs to provide real-time information, such as vaccination statistics or news updates related to the campaign.
10. Interactive Buttons ( Done)
Use inline buttons for quick responses. For example, after a user submits a ticket, you could provide buttons for them to quickly access their ticket status or submit another ticket.
11. Logging and Analytics
Implement logging to track user interactions and ticket resolutions. This data can help you analyze usage patterns and improve the bot.
12. Custom Commands
Allow users to create custom commands for specific queries or actions, making the bot more interactive.
13. User Profiles
Create user profiles that store information about their previous tickets, preferences, and contact details.
14. Gamification
Introduce a points or rewards system for users who frequently use the bot or provide feedback. This could encourage more engagement.
15. Emergency Alerts
Implement a feature to send out emergency alerts or important announcements related to the vaccination campaign.
